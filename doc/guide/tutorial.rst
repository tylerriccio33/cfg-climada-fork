Tutorial
========

The main tutorial walks you through all the functionalities of this version of CLIMADA.
There, you will find the links to additional tutorials for specific features of CLIMADA, such as different hazard and exposure models.
You can execute it by opening ``climada_python-x.y.z/doc/tutorial/1_main_climada.ipynb`` with Jupyter Notebook and the CLIMADA environment (`climada_env`) activated (i.e. CLIMADA needs to be installed as in :doc:`install`).
