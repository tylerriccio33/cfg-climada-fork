In the case of climate change and economic development, the expected annual damage by 2040 has increased with respect to the one of 2015. Assuming that the growth in annual expected damage happens linearly from 2015 to 2040, we obtain a total damage of 111 m USD by 2040. However, if the growth follows a sublinear or superlinear curve, the total amount of loss changes (take into account that the discounting is computed as well)."
