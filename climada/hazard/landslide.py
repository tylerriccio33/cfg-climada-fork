        """
        Set probabilistic landslide hazard (fraction, intensity and
        frequency) for a defined bounding box and time period from a raster.
        The hazard data for which this function is explicitly written
        is readily provided by UNEP & the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute
        (NGI), and can be downloaded and unzipped from
        https://preview.grid.unep.ch/index.php?preview=data&events=landslides&evcat=2&lang=eng
        for precipitation-triggered landslide and from
        https://preview.grid.unep.ch/index.php?preview=data&events=landslides&evcat=1&lang=eng
        for earthquake-triggered landslides.
        It works of course with any similar raster file.
        Original data is given in expected annual probability and percentage
        of pixel of occurrence of a potentially destructive landslide event
        x 1000000 (so be sure to adjust this by setting the correction factor).
        More details can be found in the landslide tutorial and under above-
        mentioned links.

        The annual occurrence probabilites are sampled from a binomial 
        distribution; intensity takes a binary value (0 - no
        ls occurrence; 1 - ls occurrence) and
        fraction stores the actual the occurrence count (0 to n) per grid cell.
        Frequency is occurrence count / n_years.

        Impact functions, since they act on the intensity, should hence be in
        the form of a step function,
        defining impact for intensity 0 and (close to) 1.

        Parameters
        ----------
        bbox : tuple
            (minx, miny, maxx, maxy) geographic extent of interest

            path to UNEP/NGI ls hazard file (.tif)
        corr_fact : float or int
            factor by which to divide the values in the original probability
            file, in case not scaled to [0,1]. Default is 1'000'000
        n_years : int
